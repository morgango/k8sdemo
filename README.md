# Oberservable Kuberentes demo using Beats and APM

1. Install minikube
2. Change the secrets in the `secrets.yaml` file as needed. Make sure you change the IP address of the Elasticsearch host. It can be your local IP or the IP/hostname of your Elastic Cloud instance. Also, make sure your loacal instance is listening on all network interfaces instead of only "localhost". Remember to use the '-n' option during encoding
3. Deploy everyting using the following command: kubectl apply -f .

Note that you will have to set up an external Elasticsearch cluster for Beats and APM to talk to. I did not configure a stateful deployment inside Kubernetes. You can install locally on your laptop, or use an Elastic Cloud instance. Again, change the secretes accordingly.
